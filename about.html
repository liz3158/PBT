                                                Maybe many people don't know me, but i remember very clearly from the first day I arrived at Politeknik Mukah I tripping over my feet and falling face, when i just walk into the school gate, well it was hurt. But nevermind once I got over that embarrassment, I still be myself
                                                <br><br>Hello, my name is Liz Wong and I'm a Senior. I'm not the type of student who will lead a senior prank or skip class with you, but that probably isn't what you want in a class president anyway. What I do offer is steadfastness, hard work and the ability to work with others even during difficult circumstances while still keeping a sense of humor.
                                                <br><br>During the last three years at Politeknik Mukah, well of course because of covid, we will had to stay home, so i only been this school like not more than one year, but its not like i don't do anything  when i was in school.  I've been involved in many activities. 
                                                I've enter many different king of club such as SITS,  spent a short time in the school library and helped tutor students after school. It probably will surprise you that I have decided to run for student council for the role of School President.
                                                <br><br>The student council works side-by-side with the student body and the administration to ensure student events throughout the year are successful. As school president , I will ensure that you have a memorable year.
                                                <br><br>As your student council president, I vow to end all homework. Just kidding. I can't do that, but what I can do is be your voice with the school administration and work to make this the best year Politeknik Mukah has ever had. I will introduce ideas for events, 
                                                such as a weekly sock hop after high school basketball games and we'll work together to help the community through volunteer work and showing them just how dedicated the students at the other school are.
                                                <br><br>I would appreciate your vote for president. If elected, I will continue to fight for the things that are important to students, no matter how big or small they might be. Let's work together to make our stamp on this community and on the world.
                                                <br><br>Today, I am asking for your vote
                                                <br><br>Should you elect me, I will listen to your concerns and work hard for you. Thank you.
